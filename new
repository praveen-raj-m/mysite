Instructions: Write a clear, professional summary with no harsh language (do not use terms like "bad" or "poor"). Keep your answer within 500 words. Do not use markdown formatting.

Step-by-step instructions:

Market Direction
Analyze the Benchmark Total Return column. If most returns are positive, state that the market was in an uptrend. Do this in a single line.

Portfolio Performance Summary
Compare the total (sum) of Portfolio Weighted Contributions with the total of Benchmark Weighted Contributions. Indicate whether the portfolio outperformed or underperformed the benchmark. State whether Total Management (alpha) across all sectors is positive or negative.

Attribution Breakdown
Break down the source of alpha:

Total Selection Effect is the sum of Attribution Selection.

Allocation Effect is derived as: Allocation = Total Management - Attribution Selection.
Determine whether most alpha came from Allocation or Selection.
Explain whether the manager overweighted strong sectors or picked better-performing stocks within each sector.

Key Sector Analysis
Identify the two sectors with the highest Total Management values and explain why they performed well.
Identify the two sectors with the lowest Total Management values and explain what caused the underperformance.
In each case, state whether it was driven by Allocation (difference in weights × benchmark return) or Selection (benchmark weight × difference in returns).

Conclusion
Summarize whether the overall alpha was driven mainly by smart sector allocation, skilled stock selection, or a combination of both.
