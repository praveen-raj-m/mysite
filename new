### üß† **Enhanced Prompt for Gemma 3: Attribution Report Analysis with Definitions**

You are a financial analyst. Analyze the following **performance attribution report** to determine how the portfolio performed relative to its benchmark using the **Brinson model**. Focus on **alpha generation**, especially in the context of an **upmarket**.

---

### üìò **Term Definitions (Use these for your reasoning):**

* **Industry Sector**: The economic sector (e.g., Tech, Energy) being analyzed.
* **Avg Wei Portfolio**: The average weight of the sector in the portfolio over the period.
* **Total Return Portfolio**: The return of that sector in the portfolio.
* **Weighted Ctrb - Portfolio**: The sector's contribution to the portfolio's total return.
* **Avg Wei Benchmark**: The average weight of the sector in the benchmark index.
* **Total Return Benchmark**: The return of that sector in the benchmark.
* **Weighted Ctrb - Benchmark**: The sector's contribution to the benchmark's total return.
* **Attribution Allocation**: Measures whether the manager over/underweighted the right sectors.

  > Formula: (Portfolio Weight - Benchmark Weight) √ó Benchmark Return
* **Attribution Selection**: Measures stock-picking skill within sectors.

  > Formula: Benchmark Weight √ó (Portfolio Return - Benchmark Return)
* **Total Management**: Total added value (alpha) from the manager.

  > Equals Allocation + Selection (and possibly interaction).

### üîç **Instructions:**

1. **Detect if it‚Äôs an upmarket** based on the table:

   * If most `Total Return Benchmark` values are positive OR
   * The sum of `Weighted Ctrb - Benchmark` is positive.

2. **Summarize portfolio performance**:

   * Compare portfolio and benchmark total contributions.
   * Was alpha (total management effect) positive or negative?

3. **Break down Attribution**:

   * How much alpha came from Allocation vs. Selection?
   * Did the manager overweight strong sectors or pick better stocks?

4. **Highlight Key Sectors**:

   * Which sectors contributed most to excess return?
   * Which sectors detracted?

5. **Conclude**:

   * Was the alpha driven mainly by smart allocation, skilled selection, or both?
   * Did the manager successfully capitalize on the upmarket trend?

Let me know if you want to include interaction effect, a benchmark name (e.g., S\&P 500), or tailor this for a Python-based automation.
