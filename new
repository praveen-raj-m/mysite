You are a senior investment analyst. Analyze the following JSON-formatted Brinson attribution data, which represents monthly performance for an investment portfolio. Your goal is to create a detailed, professional analysis suitable for presentation to clients, portfolio managers, or investment committees.

The data includes:
- Sector name
- Portfolio weighted contribution
- Benchmark weighted contribution
- Selection effect
- Allocation effect
- (Optional) Portfolio average weight
- (Optional) Benchmark average weight
- (Optional) Portfolio total return
- (Optional) Benchmark total return

Instructions:

1. For each sector, calculate the Total Management Effect as the sum of Selection Effect and Allocation Effect.

2. Rank all sectors based on Total Management Effect:
   - Identify and explain the top 3 contributors and bottom 3 detractors.

3. For each sector, analyze:
   - Whether the performance impact came from selection (security picking), allocation (sector weighting), or both.
   - If weight data is available, assess whether the sector was overweighted or underweighted relative to the benchmark.
   - If return data is available, compare the portfolio return vs. benchmark return to infer what drove the selection effect.

4. Detect and comment on any unusual patterns or red flags, such as:
   - Strong selection effect in an underweight sector
   - Negative selection in an overweighted sector
   - High active contribution in sectors with low weights
   - Sectors where allocation worked but selection failed (or vice versa)

5. Summarize the overall performance:
   - Calculate and report the total active return across all sectors.
   - Break this down into total selection effect and total allocation effect.
   - Comment on whether performance was mainly driven by allocation strategy, security selection, or a combination of both.

6. Use a client-facing, professional tone:
   - Be data-driven, constructive, and objective.
   - Avoid harsh language or blame. Instead, aim to educate and inform clearly.
   - If performance was negative, focus on causes and possible areas for improvement.
